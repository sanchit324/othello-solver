# Othello Game Solver

Welcome to my Othello Game Solver project! This project features a sophisticated Othello game solver engine developed using advanced algorithms.

## Key Features

- **Othello Game Solver Engine:** Utilizes the **Minimax algorithm** coupled with **Alpha-Beta Pruning** to significantly optimize algorithm runtime.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, allowing users to play the game between two players.

## Gameplay Visualization

Hereâ€™s a glimpse of the game interface:

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
  <img src="assets/othello_game2.png" alt="Othello Game 2" style="width: 48%;"/>
  <img src="assets/othello_game1.png" alt="Othello Game 1" style="width: 48%;"/>
</div>

In the game:

- **Green** blocks indicate **unused states**.
- **Pink** blocks represent **possible moves** for the player.
- **Black** and **White** blocks denote the corresponding players' pieces at the current state.

## Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Java**
